# sysfetch

sysfetch is a tool to display your hardware specifications, software and OS logo or any other logo of your choice. And a clone of \*fetch programs (neofetch, screenfetch) in C.

Unlike other \*fetch programs, this program does not require much resources and very speedy.

Currently this program only works on most Linux systems and more portability will be implemented such as particular OS support.
