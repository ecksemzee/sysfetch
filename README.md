# sysfetch

sysfetch is a tool to display your hardware specifications, software and OS logo or any other logo of your choice. And a clone of \*fetch programs (neofetch, screenfetch) in C.

Unlike other \*fetch programs, this program does not require much resources and very speedy.

**Please note that this program isn't fully stable and you'll likely get weird quirks outputted on different machines.**
